The wearables track activity (steps taken, distanced traveled, calories burned and activity minutes) & sleep and through the app you can also track your menstrual cycle, hydration (if not using Spring) & meditation. Their IVY wearable also tracks heart rate metrics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <font color='#E2A76F'>2.

The **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** was collected in 2016 making the datasets outdated for current trend analysis.\n2. The data initially states a time range of 03-12-2016 to 05-12-2016, after data verification, the data collected was only during a 31 day period (04-12-2016 to 05-12-2016)\n3. The dataset lacks essential demographic information such as gender, location, age, and job status. This can lead to sample selection bias in our results.

The following steps were taken within each dataset: \n1. Sorted and filtered data by Id to obtain how many unique users there were within each dataset. All blank spaces in Id were filtered out\n2. Checked for duplicate data using the ‘remove dulicate’ tool in Google Sheets\n3. Added a new colum for days of the week in dailyActivity_merged.csv. New column name was labeled as 'activity_day'\n4. To find missing information conditional formatting was used. No matching results were found. \n5. Column names for all the files used were then changed to lower case and underscores were inputted to seperate the words. I.e. TotalDistance = total_distance  \n\n     * 1. sleepDay_merged: changed column name 'totaltimeinbed' to 'total_minutes_bed'\n     * 2. dailysteps file: changed column name 'steptotal' to 'total_steps' to standardize the column names across tables \n     * 3. hourlysteps table column name 'steptotal' to 'total_steps'     \n     \n6. Separated Date and Hour into two columns when needed for later analysis. Utilized the 'Text to Columns' tool to do so. The following tables were changed:\n   * 1. hourlySteps_merged -- named new columns activity_hour & am/pm\n   * 2. hourlyCalories_merged -- named new columns activity_hour & am/pm\n\nAfter the cleaning process was done, there were only 3 rows in the sleepDay_merged file that had duplicate information.

ACT Phase</font> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"act\"></a>\n\n### 6.1 Conclusion <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conclusion\"></a> \n\nThe global fitness tracker market size was valued at 47 billion dollar in 2022 & is projected to grow from  53.94 billion dollar  in 2023 to $182.90 billion by 2030. To succeed in this competitive market, the fitness band company needs to have a strong marketing strategy. By diving into Fitbit user data, we gain invaluable insights into real-world fitness watch usage. This unveils both market gaps and user preferences, empowering us to tailor Bellabeat and highlight features that truly resonate with the audience. The most important data points is as follows:\n\n* 1. _High engagement_: 64% of users logged data for the entire data time period of 31 days. This shows that users are actively tracking their progress.\n\n* 2. _Potential for improvement_: 8% of non-usage (72 missed wearings) indicates room for improvement in encouraging consistent wear. Tuesday emerges as the day with the most missed wearings. \n\n* 3. _CDC Activity Length Recommendations_:  On average, 27 of the 33 users met the CDC Activity Length Recommendations, while 6 did not (Very Active, Fairly Active & Lightly active minutes together). \n\n* 4. _High average sedentary minutes_: Average sedentary minutes of 931.78 minutes (15 hours 31.78 minutes). The average sedentary time might be higher than recommended guidelines. For instance, some health organizations recommend limiting sitting time to less than 8 hours per day. 81% of the time by all users was spent on sedentary time hence they possibly have a less active lifestyle.\n \n* 5.  Very active minutes, fairly active minutes & Lightly active minutes rise a little during Saturdays and similarly sedendary activity does fall a little suggesting users are more likely to engage in physical activities on weekends compared to weekdays. Weekends present an opportunity to encourage and sustain healthy activity levels. By delving deeper into the reasons behind this trend and tailoring interventions accordingly, you can help users maintain a more active lifestyle throughout the week.\n \n* 6. 5 PM -7 PM is the duration of highest calories burned and hence could be the desired time of workout for all the users combined on an average.\n  \n* 7. The relationship between People who slept better and burned calories seems to be positive. Users averaging around 7 hours of sleep consistently. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6.2 Recommendations <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"recommendations\"></a>\n\n**_1. Digital Marketting_**:\n\n   **A. Partner with influencers to promote Ivy health tracker**: As seen in the above analysis, all 33 users have logged in  step, activity instensity and calorie burned features on Fitbit, Bellabeat can effectively reach its target audience by partnering with relevant influencers: a fitness expert and a registered dietitian. They can also offer exclusive discounts and promotions to influencers' followers. Schedule social media posts and email campaigns for early morning audiences.\n   \n   \n   **B.
