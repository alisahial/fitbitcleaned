To succeed in this competitive market, the fitness band company needs to have a strong marketing strategy. By diving into Fitbit user data, we gain invaluable insights into real-world fitness watch usage. This unveils both market gaps and user preferences, empowering us to tailor Bellabeat and highlight features that truly resonate with the audience. The most important data points is as follows:\n","\n","* 1. _High engagement_: 64% of users logged data for the entire data time period of 31 days. This shows that users are actively tracking their progress.\n","\n","* 2. _Potential for improvement_: 8% of non-usage (72 missed wearings) indicates room for improvement in encouraging consistent wear. Tuesday emerges as the day with the most missed wearings. \n","\n","* 3. _CDC Activity Length Recommendations_:  On average, 27 of the 33 users met the CDC Activity Length Recommendations, while 6 did not (Very Active, Fairly Active & Lightly active minutes together). \n","\n","* 4. _High average sedentary minutes_: Average sedentary minutes of 931.78 minutes (15 hours 31.78 minutes). The average sedentary time might be higher than recommended guidelines. For instance, some health organizations recommend limiting sitting time to less than 8 hours per day. 81% of the time by all users was spent on sedentary time hence they possibly have a less active lifestyle.\n"," \n","* 5.  Very active minutes, fairly active minutes & Lightly active minutes rise a little during Saturdays and similarly sedendary activity does fall a little suggesting users are more likely to engage in physical activities on weekends compared to weekdays. Weekends present an opportunity to encourage and sustain healthy activity levels. By delving deeper into the reasons behind this trend and tailoring interventions accordingly, you can help users maintain a more active lifestyle throughout the week.\n"," \n","* 6. 5 PM -7 PM is the duration of highest calories burned and hence could be the desired time of workout for all the users combined on an average.\n","  \n","* 7. The relationship between People who slept better and burned calories seems to be positive. Users averaging around 7 hours of sleep consistently.
